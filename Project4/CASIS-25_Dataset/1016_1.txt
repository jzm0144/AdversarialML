PREDICTIONS IN POLITICS can be tricky and when one commits oneself to doing active politics, it is difficult to wean the person out of it. Like Justin Bieber, one can never say never in politics – for some people, it is the constituents who urge them, they being unwilling pawns in political contests. Members of the opposition New Patriotic Party (the elephantine Kukrudites) had been on tenterhooks, waiting in earnest anticipation to hear something specific from the man who had led them twice into national elections and failed twice to get them the diadem.

While taking time in Europe to reflect on what to do in, or with, his political life, the political pundits back in Ghana were conjecturing, permuting, hypothesizing, and speculating the likely fallout from the man himself: some had predicted the man would quit active politics, and possibly, throw his weight behind his number two man, Dr Mumuni Bawumia who had won the hearts of many in the party, as well as others outside of it. Perhaps, Nana would not anticipate or contemplate a playback of the 2012 scenario in which seventeen aspirants unadvisedly competed for flag bearer-ship. At that time, Honourable Asiedu-Nketia, the NDC General Secretary, as was his custom, did as was expected of him, describing them as a gang of seventeen thieves, pirates, buccaneers, predators, purloiners, robbers, highwaymen and stealers contriving, conspiring and conniving to select their skipper.
