We hope all audiences, whether or not they’re already into wildlife, will enjoy the broadcast content and that millions will do more than that: they’ll go online and find out more; they’ll go outside and see more. The season website has everything from tips on feeding hedgehogs to advice on improving your wildlife photographs. You can download the Summer of Wildlife Handbook in which BBC wildlife presenters introduce a whole range of activities, and you can use Things To Do to find out about thousands of wildlife events being run by partners around the UK this summer.    

Which brings me back to the Saturday before last and the first of the Summer of Wildlife events BBC Learning is hosting. This was the department’s first large-scale outdoor event of the 2013 season so of course the rain tipped down in the morning, but that didn’t seem to put anyone off coming to our wonderful site, directly in front of the National Museum. As well as giving people a chance to get up close to animals we had a host of partners presenting fresh insights into our wildlife.
At this time of year, I learnt from the Cardiff University team, the undergrowth is throbbing with love duets… though you’ll need a laser vibrometer to hear them. In their display you had to match the amplified sounds to their insect creators. It’s important for all BBC Learning events that people get a chance to learn by doing and discussing rather than simply watching.
