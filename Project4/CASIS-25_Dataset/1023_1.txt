As mentioned on Fully (sic) a couple of weeks ago, the Asian Century white paper has triggered renewed discussion about the
role of teaching Asian languages in Australian schools. I am not going to add to that discussion here; rather I want to look at how
it inspired some people to comment on our own English standards, usually along the lines that we should improve our English before
we go learning Indonesian. That topic has brought a few interesting phonological observations to the surface, at least in the letters of The Age (which is my breakfast reading).

Owen White of Kew, lamented that ABC presented used to be the epitome of proper English. Now however:

    Almost universally, wanna, ganna, particuly, reguly (inter alia) are now used, and commentary and conversation are peppered with superfluous and meaningless ”you knows”.

The ABC wasn’t the only object of criticism. The PM copped some as well. This from Paul Mahoney of Black Rock:

    OWEN White makes a good point about the standard of spoken English on the ABC. He could also have mentioned our Prime Minister, who recently spruiked the white paper on the ”opportunidies” that exist through our involvement with Asia.
