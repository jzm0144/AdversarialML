Coincidentally, Dr Apraku and Dr Arthur Kennedy were part of the electioneering team for the NPP during the 2012 election campaign. As was to be expected, Johnson Asiedu – Nketia rubbished the possibility of Nana –Addo’s flag bearership of the NPP. As far as Asiedu –Nketia was concerned, they (NDC),”… welcome him with enthusiasm. We can’t wait to face him in 2016. We know his strengths and weaknesses. He will be an easy match for us in 2016.”

In an analysis which is difficult to understand in a presidential race in Ghana, Asiedu Nketia stated that Nana Akufo – Addo won four regions in the 2008 election against Prof John Evans Atta Mills but got only two regions in 2012 elections against President John Dramani Mahama. One is advised to refrain from arguments that tend to link us to regionalism, ethnicity and tribalism. The 1992 Constitution only mentions in Article 63 Clause 3 that: “A person shall not be elected as President of Ghana unless at the presidential election the number of votes cast in his favour is more than fifty percent of the total number  of the valid votes cast at the election”. Thus as far as presidential election is concerned, the whole country is one constituency. So, what is the basis for the analysis by Asiedu – Nketia? If it is not a veiled attempt just to pin the tag of NPP as Akan- Party, then we would be surprised what else the Nketiaic analysis seeks to do. Dr Tony Aidoo admonishes the Mahama’s administration to see Nana Addo’s coming as a ‘wake – up call’ to NDC. The NDC must work hard to challenge the renewed vigour in NPP, he seems to say.
