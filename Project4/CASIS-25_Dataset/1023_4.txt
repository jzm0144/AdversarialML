I therefore need to revise my earlier claim that speakers will take any shortcuts they can which do not affect clarity of communication: we have to strike the right balance between taking cognitive shortcuts – like not bothering to stop the larynx vibrating – and how we want to be perceived by our audience. Plus, it is important to keep in mind that these processes take place almost entirely below the level of conscious control. As users of language, we balance the demands on us as speakers with the needs of the hearer all the time in a way that (we hope) maximises our communicative goals but keeps us in tune with the expectations of our interlocutors.

Aside from the intrinsic interest of these topics, I must confess to an ulterior motive here. I wanted to introduce the name of  Allan Bell because he is a guest at Monash University this month and will deliver a public lecture on the evening of November 22 (details here). The lecture will look at how stereotypical features of Australian and New Zealand English are used in comedy performances, and what such performance tells us about society and nationalism in the two countries. Monash’s own Professor Kate Burridge [and winner of the 2011 Talkley award –Ed.] will contribute to the following discussion. It should be a great evening out for language lovers.

Dr Simon Musgrave is a lecturer in linguistics at Monash University. Besides working on the Southern Sudanese languages spoken in Melbourne, he is also involved in the Australian National Corpus project, which he has previously written about here.
