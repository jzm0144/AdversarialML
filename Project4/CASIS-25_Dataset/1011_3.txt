Oklahoma’s Department of Human Services (DHS) said it had moved to fire two social workers this week, the culmination of a months-long online campaign over the death of a disabled 15-year-old boy.

The case of Quinten Wood, who was born with a disorder known as Chromosome 9 Ring and was unable to walk, talk or care for himself, had reached national attention after his sister started an online petition demanding an investigation into his death.

Valerie Wood-Harber’s campaign on Change.org garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures, prompting Oklahoma authorities to examine how Wood was able to die at home from pneumonia in January 2013 despite what his sister says were repeated calls that she made to report abuse and neglect.

“I just couldn’t stand the fact that my brother had died and that nobody was doing anything about it,” Wood-Harber, 28, told the Guardian.

“I wanted at least people to learn from the situation and to see what happens when you don’t do the right thing.”

In a statement, Oklahoma DHS called the death “heart-wrenching” and credited Wood-Harber for vigorously pursuing state agencies.

“A thorough and comprehensive review of the facts and circumstances of Quinten’s death led us to the difficult and sad conclusion that the individual actions of two employees associated with this case clearly violated agency policies and reasonable child protection practices,” DHS director Ed Lake said in the statement.
