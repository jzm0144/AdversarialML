The morning of Saturday June 15th I was running late. I live in Manchester but had trains to catch for Cardiff for the first of the BBC’s big Summer of Wildlife events. The children, not yet dressed, were complaining they were hungry as I jumped on my bike for the station. One of those mornings! (Don’t worry their Dad was home, they got fed).

The back roads to Piccadilly were very quiet at that hour and my mind was on breakfast and train times when I turned a corner and there in the middle of the road was a large magpie. Magpies are hardly uncommon in the city and I wouldn’t have noticed but the bird stood quite still for a fraction longer than you’d expect with a bike speeding down. I saw it up close, the dark feathers glinting an oil-spill blue, its motionless live eye and questioning head, and suddenly I felt the thrill when something ordinary becomes extraordinary. I paused to watch the bird on its flight and wonder where it might have found to nest.
