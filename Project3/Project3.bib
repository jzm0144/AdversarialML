	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging is widely used to detect and delineate regions of the brain that change their level of activation in response to specific stimuli and tasks. Simple activation maps depict only the average level of engagement of different regions within distributed systems. FMRI potentially can reveal additional information about the degree by which components of large-scale neural systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks. In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between nodes in networks. Several different multivariate statistical methods have been adapted and applied to analyze the variations within such data. An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at rest (i.e. without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition of continuous activation. The interregional correlations between fluctuations of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent studies have established that interregional correlations between different components of circuits in each of the visual, language, motor and working memory systems can be detected in the resting state. The correlations at baseline are changed during the performance of a continuous task. In this review the various methods available for assessing connectivity are described and evaluated.},

	abstract = {We propose the use of multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models of functional magnetic resonance imaging time series to make inferences about functional integration within the human brain. The method is demonstrated with synthetic and real data showing how such models are able to characterize interregional dependence. We extend linear MAR models to accommodate nonlinear interactions to model top-down modulatory processes with bilinear terms. MAR models are time series models and thereby model temporal order within measured brain activity. A further benefit of the MAR approach is that connectivity maps may contain loops, yet exact inference can proceed within a linear framework. Model order selection and parameter estimation are implemented by using Bayesian methods.},

	abstract = {We review the evidence of pathophysiological changes in the prefrontal and temporal cortices of schizophrenic subjects and of abnormal integration of the physiological dynamics in these two regions. The argument we develop is that some schizophrenic phenomena are best understood in terms of abnormal interactions between different areas, not only at the levels of physiology and functional anatomy, but at the level of cognitive and sensorimotor functioning. We discuss recent functional imaging evidence suggesting abnormal prefronto-temporal interactions in relation to a psychological analysis of experiential symptoms in schizophrenia. Cortico-cortical interactions have been assessed in terms of functional connectivity and eigenimages, using time series of neurophysiological data obtained with positron emission tomography. The results of these analyses suggest that there is a profound disruption of large-scale prefronto-temporal interactions in schizophrenia. These disruptions are particularly relevant if one considers that many positive symptoms of schizophrenia reflect a failure to integrate intrinsically generated behaviour and concurrent perception.},

The concept of maze-solving behaviour as a continuous cognitive task evoking a conflict between prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia activity is explained and introduced to distinguish between the effects of D2 blocking agents and substances with a predominant 5HT2A receptor affinity, such as clozapine and risperidone. Complex mazes show a cognitive deficit in untreated schizophrenic patients that are impaired by conventional and improved by atypical antipsychotic substances. Processing speed improves most on clozapine, while parallel processing is best supported by the non-sedative atypical substance risperidone. Maze paradigms are presented.},

	abstract = {Clinical interest in the so-called atypical antipsychotics currently focuses on the possibility of improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the cognitive dysfunction associated with the disease. While clozapine has been shown to be effective in this respect, no data are available on zotepine. We report on a double-blind randomized study designed to evaluate the impact of zotepine and clozapine on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Cognitive function was operationalized by a maze test in which patients traversed computer-displayed mazes of increasing complexity. Passage time, route, and motor errors were evaluated. 25 schizophrenic (DSM-IIIR) patients were included in each group. After washout, they were randomized on zotepine or clozapine and given up to 450 mg of substance each. Patients were followed for six weeks and evaluated weekly. We report on a subsample of 26 patients matched for baseline BPRS, SANS, and age. 13 matched healthy persons were recruited as controls. ANOVA with group and course over time as factors was used for analysis. Both clozapine and zotepine achieved a highly significant decrease in overall symptoms (BPRS) and negative symptoms (SANS). Zotepine and clozapine were equally effective. In the maze tests, motor errors in simple mazes were stable over time and differentiated schizophrenics from controls as a "trait" marker. In passage time and maze route, schizophrenics performed worse than controls. An improvement by medication was evident in both medication groups, but was more pronounced in the zotepine-treated group. The study confirms previous results on the efficacy of clozapine and zotepine in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The data presented show for the first time that zotepine is efficacious in improving cognitive dysfunction, confirming this substance's value as an atypical antipsychotic.},
