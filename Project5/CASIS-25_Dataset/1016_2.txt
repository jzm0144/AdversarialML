But did I hear someone say the pendulum appeared to be swinging to support a possible third time for the young -old man? In presenting oldie Mills, the NDC reminded Ghanaians that one makes three visits to the oracles to seek solace. You would hear die hard and not so die – hard supporters of the NPP proclaim: “if Nana Addo does not stand, I will not vote at all” Supporters of other aspirants are now silent- perhaps adopting a calculated quietness, or a wait-and-see stance.

At the press conference in his childhood home of Nima, Nana Addo declared: “With great humility, therefore, I can announce that when the party opens nominations sometime this year, I shall be ready, God willing, to contest for the position of NPP presidential candidate for the 2016 general election”. He had chosen two professions that had no age limit- law and politics.

Nana Addo was savvy enough, not to announce himself as the flag bearer for the NPP. The party is yet to decide who the flag bearer becomes, and other interested competitors are lacing their boots to give their luck a test.
