Inside the museum we ran family quizzes through the day with some of the presenters involved in the season: Nick Baker, Iolo Williams, Miranda Krestovnikoff and Mike Dilger. "I’m not sure I’ve been so excited in my whole life," I overheard from one otherwise normal looking man. Clearly we had a serious TV wildlife fan in the audience as he added that if Chris Packham also joined the line-up, he would explode. When later I ran into the presenters outside chatting and taking every kind of wildlife question from children and adults, I shared his admiration for their passion, knowledge and desire to share.

It was appropriate our first public event was at the heart of a busy city because the season is as much about the wildlife of urban environments as it is about the countryside. Though I’ve lived in cities my entire adult life I was lucky enough to grow up in Gloucestershire, so know a country childhood is no guarantee of expertise. I was pretty good on the main breeds of cow, hard not to pick that up, but I’ve only recently begun to appreciate the wonder of birds and my recognition remains very limited - good on magpies, not so good on small brownish ones.
