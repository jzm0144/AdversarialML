The birthday was preceded by a religious activity earlier at the Ridge Church, Accra, where Nana Akufo-Addo, together with his family and other dignitaries who accompanied him, rendered gratitude to the Almighty God. Former President John Agyekum Kufuor, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia and Sam Jonah, who lost his son recently, were among a long list of personalities who graced the thanksgiving service. The church service was presided over by the Anglican Bishop of Accra, Right Rev. Dr. Daniel Sylvanus Mensah Torto.

At the Nima residence of Nana Akufo-Addo, an elaborate programme was unfolded as the septuagenarian cut a birthday cake and proceeded to receive his large retinue of guests from all walks of life in an ornate hall.
