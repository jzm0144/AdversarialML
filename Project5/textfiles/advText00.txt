Hello, my name is Aaqil Ahmed and I am the Commissioning Editor for Religion and Head of Religion and Ethics at the BBC. I’ve written a number of times about the work of our department on the About the BBC Blog - you can read some of those posts here. Today, I want to introduce a new three part documentary series entitled The Ottomans: Europe’s Muslim Emperor, that begins this Sunday at 9pm, on BBC Two.

To really understand the Middle East today and the relationship between Europe and Islam, you have to understand the Ottoman Empire, how it was created, how it evolved, how it ruled, how it collapsed and what it was followed by. Presented by Rageh Omaar, the series traces the 600 year history of the Ottoman Empire, and asks, was it an Islamic empire as most historians would tell us? Or was it something far more complicated?


The forgotten story of the world's last Islamic Empire in Europe and the Middle East.
The series isn’t just saying "let's look at 50 years of history or look at the 17th century" – it’s my belief we could have made a fantastic series alone looking at Suleiman the Magnificent (or Suleiman the Law Giver), for example. Instead, we’re focusing our series on who these people are and why their story is told in the way it is. What can we learn from the empire they created and the state that followed it? And what does it tell us about the world we live in today?
