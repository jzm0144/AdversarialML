“Based upon the information that has been obtained, the decision has been made to initiate steps to terminate those employees.”

Wood lived with his brother, Cameron, at the home of their and Wood-Harber’s father in Oklahoma. (Wood-Harber has a different mother and lives in Arkansas.)

Cameron, then 14, had told his sister they were being neglected in the weeks before Wood died, she said. Wood-Harber said she alerted Oklahoma Child Welfare Services in December 2012. She called Child Welfare Services every day for three weeks, she said, until Wood’s death on 4 January.

Wood-Harber said that a social worker visited Wood at school but a follow-up visit at his home was not carried out.

“If Oklahoma Child Welfare Services had done their job and followed through with a home visit, they would have found Quinten and Cameron’s living conditions deplorable,” Wood-Harber said in the petition, adding that intervention “could have saved Quinten’s life”.

DHS said a criminal investigation into Wood’s death is ongoing.

Michael Wood, Quinten’s father, has previously denied that he was at fault.

“If I didn’t care properly for Quinten, he wouldn’t have lived 15 years, especially when we were told that he wouldn’t live to see a year,” he told CNN in October 2013.

Wood-Harber’s petition called on the Governor of Oklahoma to investigate Oklahoma Child Welfare Services and Midwest City public schools “to hold neglectful parties responsible for my brother’s death and ensure other children don’t suffer the way he did”. It has almost 500,000 signatures to date.
