Commenting on the leadership qualities required of NPP top – notch, and coinciding with the announcement of Nana Akufo Addo, Dr Kofi Konadu Apraku enunciated the need for “strong leadership” to win power from the NDC. To him, it was unsafe to “rely on the fact that the economy was not doing well to automatically win the election as the situation now is not different from that of 2012”.This appears to be an innocuous observation, and those NPP members who think they can win power from the NDC without effort are deceiving themselves, since the economy can improve, and NDC know of so “many ways of killing a cat” whether the phrase is an allusion to forcing judges to “toe the line” or “rig elections”.

The loquacious Arthur – Kennedy was of the view that Nana Addo ought to check himself after taking NPP twice to the polls and failing twice to win.  Yes, Nana Addo has checked himself, and sees himself “… spiritually, psychologically, emotionally, intellectually, physically, and patriotically strong enough to remain in the hury-burly  of frontline politics”.
