"For 2012, 21.22% of the total budget was allocated to education. The total 2012 budget was GHC13, 529, 706,950 out of which GHC 2,871,680,218 was budgeted for education. Total allocation from general education budget for basic education was GHC1, 784,540,000. Despite the investment, the sector still faces some challenges. Prominent among them is the poor performance of B.E.C.E students over the past decade. A total of 1,562, 270 students have failed the B.E.C.E exams over the past decade. The question we ask ourselves is; where are the 1,562270 children who dropped out over the decade? What is their fate? How can hope be restored to these people? How do we curb the situation? We cannot benefit from a petrochemicals industry and technology based industries with such an educational profile.

It is evident that the Ghanaian educational system among other things lacks the needed quality, and monitoring. This can be linked to type of training we give at our teacher training colleges, availability of facilities and instructional materials and the poor performance of our Monitoring and Supervision teams at the Ministry of Education and Ghana Education Service both at the national and district levels. Finally, there is perhaps a reason why the requirement of the 1992 constitution for free and compulsory education has been ignored by those who have had the opportunity to lead this nation. There is a reason why great ideas have escaped us. Transformation needs great minds and insightful leadership." PAA KWESI NDUOM'S ARTICLE ON FREE EDUCATION.
