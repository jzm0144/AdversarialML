The most profound highlight of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo- Addo’s 70th birthday party at his Nima residence last Saturday was a presentation of two Holy Scriptures – Holy Bible and Holy Quran – to the newly-turned septuagenarian by the Abontidomhene of Kyebi, Osabarima Kyeretwie Boakye Danquah.

The presentation went with an admonition to the politician/lawyer to continue being truthful as he has always been.

“You have always been truthful. Continue being so, as you keep these important scriptures,” the chief told Nana.

The Holy Scriptures representing the two great religions of the world – Christianity and Islam – symbolize moral purity of which truth is a critical component.
